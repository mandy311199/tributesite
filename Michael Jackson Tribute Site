		<h3> 1958–1975: Early life and the Jackson 5 </h3>
		<img src="images/jackson5.jpg" alt="this is a pciture of Michael Jackson" />
		<p > Michael Joseph Jackson[7][8] was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958.[9] He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street.[10][11] His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears.[12] She was a Jehovah's Witness.[13] His father, Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income.[14][15] His father's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout.[16] Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy).[14] A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.[17] </p>  
		<h3> 1982–1983: Thriller and Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever </h3>
		<p >  Jackson recorded with Queen singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of "State of Shock", "Victory" and "There Must Be More to Life Than This". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but, according to Queen's manager Jim Beach, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a llama into the recording studio,[58] and Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug use.[59] The songs were released in 2014.[60] Jackson went on to record "State of Shock" with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons' album Victory (1984).[61] In 1982, Jackson contributed "Someone in the Dark" to the storybook for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The song, produced by Jones, won a Grammy for Best Recording for Children for 1983.[54</p>
		<h3> 1986–1987: Changing appearance, tabloids, and films </h3>
		<p >  Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including rumors that he had been bleaching his skin.[97][98][99] According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1984, which causes white patches on the skin, and had also been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, which was in remission. Both conditions made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches, he could appear even paler.[100] Jackson said that he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, but never purposely bleached his skin. He said that he could not control his vitiligo.</p> 
		<h3> 1993–1995: Marriage to Lisa Marie Presley </h3> 
		<img src="images/presley.jpg" alt="this is a picture of michael Jackson" />
		<p>  In August 1993, a 13-year-old boy Jackson had shared a bed with accused him of sexual abuse. After a police investigation, no charges were brought.[160] Jackson began taking painkillers, Valium, Xanax and Ativan to cope with the stress of the allegations. By late 1993, he was addicted to the drugs.[161] He relied on Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, for emotional support; she was concerned about his health and drug addictions.[161] They had known each other since she was seven and attended one of Jackson's family engagements.[162] The two stayed in contact every day on the phone. Presley sympathized with Jackson and believed he was innocent; she persuaded him to settle out of court with the boy's family, and go into rehabilitation.</p>
		<h3> 1997–2005: Label dispute and Invincible </h3> 
		<p>  From October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked on his tenth solo album, Invincible, which cost $30 million to record.[184] In June 1999, Jackson joined Luciano Pavarotti for a War Child benefit concert in Modena, Italy. The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the Kosovo War, and additional funds for the children of Guatemala.[185] Later that month, Jackson organized a series of "Michael Jackson & Friends" benefit concerts in Germany and Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The Scorpions, Boyz II Men, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, A. R. Rahman, Prabhu Deva Sundaram, Shobana, Andrea Bocelli, and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO.[186] From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East 74th Street.[187] At the turn of the century, Jackson won an American Music Award as Artist of the 1980s.[188] In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer</p>
		<h3> 2006–2009: Closure of Neverland, final years, and This Is It </h3> 
		<p> In March 2006, Jackson failed to make repayments on a $270 million loan secured against his music publishing holdings, which were making him $75 million a year.[200] Bank of America sold the debt to Fortress Investments. Sony proposed a restructuring deal which would give them a future option to buy half of Jackson's stake in their jointly-owned publishing company, leaving Jackson with a 25% stake.[175] The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure.[201] Jackson agreed to a Sony-backed refinancing deal in April 2006.[</p> 
		<h3> Death </h3> 
		<p> On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before the first show was due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from a cardiac arrest.[224] Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC), and arrived three minutes later.[225][226] Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed.[227] Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and for more than an hour after arriving there, but were unsuccessful,[228][229] and he was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC).[</p> 
		<h2  id="a"> Artistry </h2> 
		<h3> Influences </h3> 
		<p> Jackson was influenced by musicians including James Brown, Little Richard,[296] Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire,[296] Sammy Davis Jr.,[296] Gene Kelly,[296] and David Ruffin.[297] Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson,[298] but Brown was his greatest inspiration; he later said that as a small child, his mother would waken him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being "mesmerized".[</p> 
		<h3> Music videos and choreography </h3> 
		<p> Jackson released "Thriller", a 14-minute music video directed by John Landis, in 1983.[334] The zombie-themed video "defined music videos and broke racial barriers" on MTV, which had launched two years earlier.[37] Before Thriller, Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African American.[335] Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing "Billie Jean" and later "Beat It", which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, and helped other black music artists gain recognition.[336] The popularity of his videos on MTV helped the relatively new channel's viewing figures, and MTV's focus shifted toward pop and R&B.[336][337] His performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever changed the scope of live stage shows, making it acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on stage.[338] The choreography in Thriller has been copied in Indian films and prisons in the Philippines.[339] Thriller marked an increase in scale for music videos, and was named the most successful music video ever by the Guinness World Records.</p> 
		<h2> Legacy and influence </h2> 
		<p> Jackson has been referred to as the "King of Pop" because he transformed the art of music videos and paved the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation.[172] His music and videos, such as Thriller, fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring.[37] He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records.[388][389] He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century,[390] and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades</p> 
		<h2> Honors and awards </h2> 
		<p> Jackson was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980 as a member of the Jacksons, and in 1984 as a solo artist. He also won the World Music Awards' Best-Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium, the American Music Award's Artist of the Century Award and the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award.[409] He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and again as a solo artist in 2001.[410] In 2002 he was added to the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[411] In 2010, Jackson was the first pop and rock 'n' roll performer inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame,[412] and in 2014 he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame</p>
		<h2> Earnings </h2> 
		<p> Jackson had 13 number-one singles in the US in his solo career—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era[420]—and estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide[421][Note 2] making him one of the best-selling artists in music history</p>
